This MERN (Mongo Express React Node) project is a social media app where users can sign up and upload places they have been. Other users are able to see everyone's places and view it using Google Maps. 

Since this app contains both frontend and backend work, it took quite a while to build. It uses many tools, libraries and frameworks. While it works well, there are a few bugs I'm still working on. I also plan to implement a feature to allow users to have friends and be able to comment on eachothers places. 

There will be much more work done so keep an eye out!
